# Introduction

During development work, I'll add to this document a description of how the new clothing system works. It's easier to do this step by step, while working on the single changes, instead of writing it all after the work is done.

Ultimately, the contents of this document can be used to document the new system (either in the sources or in a separate document), with only slight adaptations being required.

During the development stages, and before merging into `master`, this document provides an important reference for checking that everything is fine with new system, especially for asking end-users opinions on these changes.
