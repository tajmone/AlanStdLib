; which doesn't use the 'worn' entity any more to store clothes worn by Hero.

; CLOTHING INITIALIZATION
; ==============================================================================
; Let's check that clothes have been properly initialized by the library.
; In the source adventure, worn items are places IN the wearing actor and set as
; 'IS donned', the library then takes care of adding them to the 'wearing' set.

; HERO'S CLOTHING -> OK!
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inventory
DBG sneakers
DBG boxers
DBG socks
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; NPC CLOTHING  -> OK!
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
examine assistant
DBG boots
DBG uniform
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; NESTED CLOTHING AND OBJECTS -> OK!
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Let's check that clothing items inside worn clothes are seen as being just
; carried, not worn. Previously the library would mark as 'donned' any object
; inside a worn item.
examine khakis
DBG khakis
; The kippah shouldn't be 'donned' nor in 'wearing' of Hero:

; CLOTHES LISTINGS      ( WIP )
; ==============================================================================
; Currently taking inventory doesn't show two separate lists for carried and
; worn items. Still needs to be implemented:
inventory
; ==============================================================================
; WEARING & REMOVING    ( WIP )
; ==============================================================================
; The 'wear' and 'remove' verbs haven't yet been adapted to work with the new
; system, so they are not working right now.
