; We must check that with the new system all clothing items are initialized
; correctly.
; 
; Now authors only need to create a clothing instance directly in the wearing
; actor and set it as `IS donned`; the library will take care of the rest.
; 
; ** WARNING ** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;               Currently the verbs 'i', 'wear' and 'remove' have not been fixed
;               to work with the new system, so they will not work as expected!
;               Also, the DBG verb still reports a clothing item status regarding
;               the 'worn' entity and the 'wearing' set, which are now no longer
;               handled by the library at initialize time, so the report values
;               are no longer significant for the tests (except to track verbs
;               which might still be handling them, which they shouldn't).
